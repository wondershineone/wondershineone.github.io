## Performance
**Indication of the responsiveness** of a system to execute **any action** within a **given time interval**
<br><br>

## Scalability
The ability of a system either to handle increases in load without impact on performance or **for the available resources to be readily increased**
<br><br>

## Availability
The ability to not “500 Service not Available” <br>
**the percentage of time** that the infrastructure, system or a solution remains operational under normal circumstances in order to serve its intended purpose. <br>
**Percentage of availability = (total elapsed time — sum of downtime)/total elapsed time**
<br><br>

## Reliability
In performance: **the probability** that the system will meet certain performance standards in yielding **correct output** for a **desired time duration**. <br>
how well the service will be available in context of different real-world conditions <br>

In data: after data updated, updated data should be returned.
<br><br>

## Usability
How effectively end users can use, learn, or control the system.
<br><br>

## Maintainability (or Flexibility / Testability)
The ability of the system to support changes
<br><br>

## Reusability
A chance of using a component or system in other components/systems with small or no change.
<br><br>

## Security
The ability of the system to reduce the likelihood of malicious or accidental actions as well as the possibility of theft or loss of information.
<br><br>

## Manageability
The ability to manage the system to ensure the continued health of a system with respect to scalability, reliability, availability, performance, and security.
<br><br>

## Cost
Includes: hardware cost + software cost + management cost + deploy cost + **educational cost**
<br><br>

## Extensibility
the ability to add additional functionality or modify existing functionality without impacting existing system functionality.
