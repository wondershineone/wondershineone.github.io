Peterson's solution requires 2 data item shared with 2 processes
```
int turn;
boolean flag[2];
```

if **turn == i, Process[i] can run** in critical section.
if **flag[i] == True, Process[i] is ready** to enter critical section.

### Process i code
```
while(true) {
  flag[i] = TRUE;
  turn = j;
  
  while(flag[j] && turn == j) {
    // do nothing
  }
  // critical section
  ...
  flag[i] = FALSE;
  // remainder section
  ...
}
```

### Process j code
```
while(true) {
  flag[j] = TRUE;
  turn = i;
  
  while(flag[i] && turn == i) {
   // do nothing
  }
  // critical section
  ...
  
  flag[j] = FALSE;
  // remainder section
  ...
}
```

## 1. Mutual Exclusion
(if Process1 runs in its critical section, other processes cannot be run in their critical sections)

**proof)**
(Note that with state "flag[0] != flag[1]", mutual exclusion is guaranteed)
Let's say flag[0] == flag[1] == true.

As variable "turn" can only have one value at one time,
only one process can pass while condition and enters critical section.

Lets say turn == j and Process[j] enters critical section. Then Process[i] runs "line 5" one more time.

one that moment, as flag[j] == true and turn == j, Process[i] cannot enter critical section.

That is,
with status flag[0] != flag[1], mutual exclusion is guaranteed.
with status flag[0] == flag[1] == true, mutual exclusion is also guaranteed.

## 2. Progress

Let's say Process[j] is run in critical section, while Process[i] is waiting in while block.
When Process[j] ends, it set flag[1] = False. As Process[i] does not change turn or flag in while state, it goes to critical section.

## 3. Bounded waiting
Same with 2). As Process[i] does not changes turn or flag in while state, it goes to critical section.
